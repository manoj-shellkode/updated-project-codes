processors – no small commitment 
after the unmitigated disaster of its 
previous effort to embrace ARM, 
Windows RT.
However, it’s now been suggested 
that the faults with the Surface 
hardware were nothing to do 
with Intel, but with Microsoft’s 
own software drivers. 
This only came to light when 
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella visited 
PC builder Lenovo and asked how 
the company was coping with 
theSkylake problems. According 
to Thurrott’s sources, Lenovo’s 
management were bewildered, 
telling Nadella they had experienced 
no reliability issues with Intel’s 
processors at all. It appears 
Microsoft’s CEO had been led up 
the garden path by his own staff. 
If true, it suggests Microsoft’s 
engineers were so concerned about 
covering their backsides that they 
misled their own CEO. Microsoft 
declined to comment on the 
company’s internal machinations.  

QConsumer confidence
While the revelations might 
temporarily sour relations between 
Microsoft and Intel, the row is 
unlikely to distract consumers, 
many of whom don’t know or don’t 
care what components are in their 
laptops – especially if the hardware 
is Microsoft-branded.

“I think this whole issue of Intel 
support is a red herring,” said Cherry.  
“I am using Surface hardware because 
in the event of a problem, I want to 
be able to walk into a Microsoft store 
and say ‘this isn’t working, fix it’. 
“The hardware and the software 
have its name on them, so I don’t care 
who made the processor, the disk 
drive, the RAM or even the pen which 
I never use. As far as I’m concerned, 
it’s all from Microsoft.” 

 It appears 
Microsoft’s CEO 
Satya Nadella had 
been led up the garden 
path by his own staﬀ
  

4 TalkTalk hit with ICO 
fine over data care
TalkTalk was hit with a £100,000 fine by 
the Information Commissioner’s Office for 
leaking 21,000 customer accounts to hackers 
in an Indian call centre, its second ICO fine in a 
year. The data was used to target customers 
with fake support calls, after “unjustifiably 
wide-ranging” permissions were given to 
staff of an Indian outsourcing firm.

5 Brexit investment 
pain for startups
UK tech startups face a huge drop in funding 
after the European Investment Fund – which 
poured €2.3 billion into the UK between 2011 
and 2015 – turned off the tap. The EIF said 
there was no official block on post-Article 50 
investment, but multiple venture-capital 
funds told media outlets the cash had 
simply dried up.

1 RBS to shed 40% 
of London IT staff
The Unite union claimed that taxpayer-owned 
bank RBS was to cut 40% of its UK IT staff, 
with the loss of 900 jobs due to cost-cutting, 
restructuring and offshoring.  The bank 
said any changes were down to it being 
a “simpler, smaller” bank, but Unite 
said the cuts coming into effect by 
2020 would leave it “operating 
a skeleton service”.

2 Google searching 
for sexism answers
Google came under fire for its lack of 
diversity after an engineer’s internal 
manifesto went viral after claiming 
that “the distribution of preferences 
and abilities of men and women differ 
in part due to biological causes”. The 
engineer was swiftly fired, but the 
fallout highlighted divisions over how 
women and minorities are treated and 
paid at the company.
