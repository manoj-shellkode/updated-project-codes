      "Non Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOFDM) systems make use of a transmission signal set which is not restricted to orthonormal bases unlike previous OFDM systems. The usage of non-orthogonal bases generally results in a trade-off between Bit Error Rate (BER) and receiver complexity. This paper studies the use of Gabor based on designing a Spectrally Efficient Multi-Carrier Modulation Scheme. Using Gabor Transform with a specific Gaussian envelope; we derive the expected BER-SNR performance. The spectral usage of such a NOFDM system when affected by a channel that imparts Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is estimated. We compare the obtained results with an OFDM system and observe that with comparable BER performance, this system gives a better spectral usage. The effect of window length on spectral usage is also analyzed.\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "With a growth in the number of users, there is an increase in the demand for spectrum. Research pertaining to the efficient use the available spectrum has produced numerous results over the past few years. This work came to fruition in the form of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing, which is a special class of Multiple Carrier Modulation that has emerged as a leading candidate for high data rate wireless communication. The main advantage of this is its ease of implementation that eliminates ICI at low receiver complexity.\n",

      "5. Summary\n",
      "The NOFDM system has been implemented. The BER vs SNR performance for a system implemented using a Gabor basis with sigma value of 2/Ï€ was found to be optimal and comparable to that of a OFDM system. The spectrum is found to be more efficient than that of OFDM systems and also the bandwidth is found to be inversely proportional to the window length of the Gabor transform.\n",
